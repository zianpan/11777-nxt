Specifically, you should focus on output rationales first.\nThe rationales should also include in curly braces the answer to the question.\n\nHere are some examples that you can follow:\nQuestion: What is in the motorcyclist's mouth?\nChoices: 0. toothpick 1. food 2. popsicle stick 3. cigarette\nRationale: Looking at the picture, we can see a man with white shirt riding a motorcycle. Now as we find the motorcyclist in the question, we can see that he has a cigarette in his mouth.\n\nQuestion: Which number birthday is probably being celebrated?\nChoices: 0. one 1. ten 2. nine 3. thirty\nRationale: From the question, we know that someone is celebrating for the birthday. Looking at the picture, we can see two things on the table top. One is a grey bear which is likely to be a cake, the other is a cake with several candles on it. By looking at the purple cake, we can see it writes number thirty on it.\n\nQuestion: What best describes the pool of water?\nChoices: 0. frozen 1. fresh 2. dirty 3. boiling\nRationale: Looking at the picture, we can see a tree in the middle.

The pool is dark brown and it is brown and surrounded with mud. So the pool is dirty.\nHere is the question and choices you have.\nQuestion: How can you tell the incense has been burned already?\nChoices: 0. smoke 1. faded decor 2. oil down 3. ashes\nYou should output rationale step by step based on the image and the OCR result.Now please output the rationale.\n Rationale:\n\nThe incense has been burned already because there are ashes on the incense stick.\n This is the previous response. Is it possible that other choices might be the correct? Provide feedback based on it. \n Feedback:\n\nThe previous response is incorrect. The correct answer is not among the options provided.\n\nThe incense has been burned already because there are ashes on the incense stick.\n This is previous response.
