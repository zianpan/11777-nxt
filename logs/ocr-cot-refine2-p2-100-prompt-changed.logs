    Question: What are the orange vehicles for?
Choices: 0. police 1. shuttle 2. passengers 3. air traffic
This is the description of the four choices: The main subject of the question is an airport, with two large planes on the tarmac and several vehicles in the foreground.

The four choices are:

0. Police: This option is not relevant to the context of the airport scene.
1. Shuttle: The orange vehicles in the foreground could be shuttle buses, which are commonly used to transport passengers between terminals or to and from the airport.
2. Passengers: While passengers may be transported by the orange vehicles, this option is too broad and does not specifically describe the purpose of the vehicles.
3. Air traffic: This option is not relevant to the context of the airport scene, as air traffic refers to the movement of aircraft in the air, not on the ground.

Based on the description of the airport scene and the context of the question, the most likely purpose of the orange vehicles is to transport passengers, specifically as shuttle buses. Therefore, the correct answer is:

*Answer*: 1. shuttleYou should output Rationals step by step based on the image and the OCR result.Now please output the rationale.
 Rationale:

The image shows an airport scene with two large planes on the tarmac and several vehicles in the foreground. The orange vehicles in the foreground are likely shuttle buses, which are commonly used to transport passengers between terminals or to and from the airport.
