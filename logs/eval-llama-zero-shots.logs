<END OF CASE>
The image depicts three sheep standing in a field, with one sheep on the left having a distinctive object on its head. This object appears to be a pair of horns. Upon examining the other two sheep, it is evident that they also possess horns, albeit smaller in size. 

Considering the options provided, the correct answer is:

{1. zombie}

This conclusion is based on the observation that the horns on the sheep's heads bear a resemblance to the horns typically associated with zombies in popular culture. The presence of horns on the sheep's heads, combined with the context of the image, leads to the inference that the object on the animal's head is similar to what is found on a zombie's head.

The image shows a pizza with various toppings, including pepperoni, mushrooms, banana peppers, and red peppers. A person is holding a fork over the pizza, suggesting that they are about to eat it.

To determine which vegetable on the pizza would be risky for someone with a certain allergy, we need to consider the common food allergies. The most common food allergies are peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, wheat, and soy. Among these, the most relevant to the pizza toppings are:

* Peanuts and tree nuts: not present in the image
* Milk and eggs: not present in the image
* Fish and shellfish: not present in the image
* Wheat: not present in the image
* Soy: not present in the image

Therefore, the only vegetable on the pizza that could potentially cause an allergic reaction is the pepperoni, which is made from pork and beef. However, since pepperoni is a meat product, it is not a
